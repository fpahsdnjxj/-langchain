Mycroft's presence in the narrative signifies a formidable intellect that rivals Sherlock's, yet he often prefers the comforts of bureaucratic life over the active pursuit of fieldwork. Thus, he serves as both a confidant and a source of support for Sherlock, illustrating the deep connection between the two brothers.\n"

Notably, the most successful detective novel prior to Holmes's illustrious debut was penned by the New Zealand barrister Fergus Hume. His masterful work, *The Mystery of a Hansom Cab*, published in 1886, achieved remarkable acclaim, selling over 300,000 copies in Britain alone within merely six months of its release.\n",

While it may lack the scientific method and the iconic status of Holmes, it undeniably laid significant groundwork for the detective fiction that would follow. In fact, Hume’s work is a testament to the rich landscape of mystery literature that existed prior to Conan Doyle’s celebrated detective, and it serves as a reminder that the genre was already thriving, filled with its own compelling narratives, before Holmes eclipsed them all.\n"
